Research Experience
======
* A Computation-aware Motion Planning and Control Architecture with Event-triggered MPC for Autonomous Vehicles, Dec 2020-Aug 2021 

  Master Thesis, _City University of Hong Kong_                                                                                  
  
  * Fields: Autonomous Vehicle, MPC, Optimisation
  * Supervisor: Dr. Ehsan Nekouei	

    An overtaking control architecture for overtaking is developed for autonomous vehicles using Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed architecture is comprised of three components:Trajectory Planner, MPC and a low-level Controller.


* Herbicide Spraying Algorithm based on Pattern Recognition for Spraying Drones, Jun 2018-May 2019

  Innovative and Entrepreneurial Project, _Hefei University of Technology_                                                                                  
  
  * Fields: Image Processing, Drones
  * Role: Algorithms Team Leader
  * Supervisor: Dr.  Qi Tan
  
    Precise spraying of the herbicides algorithms install on the drones was achieved by identifying weeds in the grains in order to save herbicide consumption and reduce pollution.
